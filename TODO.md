# TODO
1. Add `month` and `year` fields to `start` and `end` dates
2. Use GraphQL to only pull fields from `resume.json` whose `tags` fields has a nonempty intersection with a set of tags provided as input. This way you can render different content for different viewers. 
3. Improve command line interface so you can specify which `Resume(.*).js` component to use and/or which tags (see previous bullet) to include.
